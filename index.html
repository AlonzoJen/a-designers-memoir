    Today was a rather big milestone for me. When I started this UX/UI Bootcamp, 
    I was bright-eyed and bushy tailed. I was so anxious to learn all there was to 
    know on what it takes to become a graphic designer. To say that this has indeed 
    been a challenge would be an understatement. 
    <br><br> Today, however, I launched/published my very own website. Yes, while it isn't much 
    to start out with, yet these very few lines are a testament that I can do this! 
    I am eager to see where this new adventure will take me.

    <br> <br> Stay tuned... There is a whole lot more to come.
